# Excel Formula Compiler

This project is a work-in-progress Excel formula compiler implemented in Zig. Currently, only parsing and "bytecode" generation are supported. It's like giving your Excel formulas a Zig makeover â€“ stylish and stack-based.

## Features

- **Excel Formula Parsing:** Because who doesn't love deciphering Excel formulas?
- **Stack Bytecode Generation:** Turning those formulas into bytecode, because why not?

## Future Possibilities
- **Full Excel File Import: Support for importing entire Excel files, including multiple sheets and cell references.
- **Binary Compilation: Compiling Excel files into binary for efficient calculations.
